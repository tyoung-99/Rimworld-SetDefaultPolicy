Default policy
Use Harmony to add code to Dialogue_ManagePolicies to add button that changes Policy.id to 0, swaps id w/ Policy w/ id 0.
Alternately
Make subclass of Policy that can update id. Somehow turn every subclass of Policy into subclass of my subclass. Use set method in change above.

Policy order
Add dropdown to Dialogue_ManagePolicies for selecting display order.
Ensure dropdown when assigning policies follows order, and puts default policy at top.
